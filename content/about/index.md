Annette and Dan live in a rural village in Hampshire with our two young children. We have recently moved to a Â½ acre plot with lots of trees and a bungalow which we are planning on knocking down to rebuild our family home. This blog will document the self build process from planning to a finished house, ideas, choices and general DIY, how we did it and what we learnt along the way.

Dan is a fan of DIY and will get stuck into many tasks which involves tools - from painting and decorating, fitting kitchens/bathrooms, building a shed from scratch, digging holes, fencing, decking, jet washing to car building and maintenance. 
Dream House must have - Large Garage with workshop. 

Annette has watched too many episodes of Grand Designs and Building the Dream.
Dream house must have - Bath with a view. 

Lots of pictures and videos will follow once the building starts. Watch this space.

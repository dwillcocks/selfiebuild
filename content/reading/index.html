{{< book link="https://amzn.to/37crsUw" title="The Eco-Home Design Guide: Principles and practice for new-build and retrofit" authors="Christopher Day" image="ecohome.jpg" size="300x" >}}
  Designing an eco home is as much about working with your natural surroundings as it is about planning to use the right materials for your building. In this book, Christopher Day draws on his extensive experience to explain the key principles of eco-home design, focussing on natural methods rather than expensive technology. Fully illustrated, it highlights how aesthetics, comfort, and economy arise from eco-responsible design: they're not add-ons, nor are ecology and art in conflict. This book will give you essential guidance in: working with the surrounding landscape; choosing materials; making sure your eco home suits your needs; and retro-fitting an existing building.
